<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Stanford University. <br>

I investigate how listeners hear, understand, and remember spoken language. Why?  Well, because each one of us produces our own bubbles of variation when we talk, and my bubble doesn’t overlap with anyone else’s bubble.  So we have tons of variation in speech and we understand each other remarkably well, understanding spoken words coming into our ears at 5 - 7 syllables a second.  That’s nuts! <br>

How do we do it?? My starting point is that this variation is information. From birth, we are exposed to a complex speech patterns that we learn to associate with words and sounds, but also with talker information inclusing a variety of individual and various group attributes.  These asociations are part of what help us understand spoken language as quickly as we do, but the downside is this is also a pathway to bias. <br> 

With all that in mind, I look at the social aspects of talkers and listeners, and try to understand how we experience linguistic events, how we encode them with all of this cued and inferred social information, how we weight different experiences in memory, and why this all matters in every day situations.  

<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>

I have been working as a phonetician at Stanford for 16 years, running a departmental experimental lab for the bulk of that, and now running a lab focused on the social aspects of speech and language processing and memory.  I collaborate with various scholars and teams to investigate human behavior using methods from behavioral, social, and neurosciences. <br>

<h3>STUDENTS</h3>

I am lucky enough to be working with a group of bright, creative, and forward-thinking students: [Alexia Hernandez](https://github.com/alexiah53), [Yin Lin Tan](https://yinlintan.github.io/), [Marie Tano](https://mariemmanue.github.io/), Anton de la Fuente, Irene Yi, Will Clapp.
